Get more information for a single or multiple repositories with a single command.

## Inspiration
Simultaneously working with multiple git repositories can be really annoying. 
Like the knowing the current branch names, is there anything to pull or push,
or Do I have any uncommitted changes?

`ges`  tries to solve this problem.



## Installation

1. Clone the repository in your home directory
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sandeep1995/git-extra-status.git $HOME
```
2. Add the `bin` path in your global path. You can do it in your `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file.
```
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/git-extra-status/bin
```

### Single usage
Go to any git repository and execute 
```bash
ges
````

### Batch Usage
